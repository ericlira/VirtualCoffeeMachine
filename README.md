Sample code

The machine will accept 1,2,5,10,20,50 cent, 1 and 2 dollar coins. However 1 and 2 cent coins are to be rejected.

With the total amount of coins inputted equal or greater, the user has the choice of three different coffees - each type having a different cost.
  1. $3.50 Cappuccino
  2. $3.00 Latte
  3. $4.00 Decaf

The machine is to dispense the correct coffee and change (if change is required its to be broken up into coinage).
